# BJT Current Mirror using BC547B Transistors

This project involves the design, simulation, and experimental verification of a BJT current mirror and half current mirror using BC547B NPN transistors. The goal is to replicate and divide current accurately across transistors using analog design techniques.

## Features

- Implemented both current mirror and half current mirror configurations.
- Simulated the circuits using LTspice.
- Built and tested the circuits on a breadboard.
- Compared simulation results with practical measurements.

## Tools Used

- LTspice for simulation
- Breadboard setup for hardware implementation
- BC547B transistors and standard electronic components

## Summary

This group project provided hands-on experience with analog biasing techniques and highlighted the importance of matching and circuit layout in analog circuit performance.
